# Hw7 - New Mood

In this homework, I am trying to analyze the tweet sentiment of 5 media sources' most recent 100 tweets. The 5 media sources are BBC, CBS, CNN, FoxNews, and New York Times. The packages that were used include tweepy(a python library that parses the Twitter API), VADER(a python library that analyzes the Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Compound sentiment scores of a given text), and matplotlib. 

After my analysis, here are 3 conclusions that were observed:
1. The majority of the tweets from these media sources are neutral to positive
2. CBS's aggregate compound sentiment score is the most positive 
3. Fox News' aggregate compound sentiment score is the least positive
